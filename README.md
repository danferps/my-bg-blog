## Technologies Used

- **Semantic HTML**: The website uses semantic HTML to ensure that the structure of the pages is meaningful and accessible. Proper use of HTML5 tags helps in maintaining clean and standard-compliant markup, which is also beneficial for SEO and accessibility.

- **CSS**: Styling is handled via CSS, ensuring that the site is visually appealing and functional on any device. We use modern CSS practices to provide a responsive and user-friendly experience. The CSS follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, which helps in creating reusable components and code sharing in frontend development, making the CSS easier to read and maintain.

- **JavaScript (JS)**: JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity and ensure a dynamic user experience. It handles DOM manipulations, event handling, and asynchronous operations that make the website more engaging.

- **Accessibility Focus**: We prioritize accessibility to make sure our content is available to all users, including those with disabilities. This includes keyboard navigability, screen reader support, and ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility features.
